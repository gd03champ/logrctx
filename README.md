# My Ideas

- Python based cli application that can pull in logs from loki, process the logs using llm and return reduced logs

- The application gets queries to gets logs from api from command line parameters while calling the application

- If any parameter is not given by user, no errors, the application runs and get's the input from user in runtime

- The result could probably contain some anamolies and analytics data from the reduced logs also preferably

---

# To Use

- Python as main lang
    - later let's migrate to go

- Typer for cli app

- Rich for cli interface

- Loki api to retrieve logs
    - stores to a file

- RapidFuzz - string matching processing before llm (new context)

- Transformer for llm runtime and rag
    - fuzzed logs passed to llm for further reduction and analysis
    - later lets migrate to llama.cpp

- Using RAG, raw logs will be fed to model finally
    - llm ready to answer any question in context to raw logs though rag


# Progress

- Setup sample logs
    - Get log contexts from yatin gmeet (ll)
        - Also get info on how to get alarms pod topic for anothet ticket
    - Setup loki api rtreival system (ll)

- Check Rapidfuzz with sample logs

- Cascade rapidfuzz ouput to phi-3 for analysis
    - Most analysys and further reduction

- rag for raw logs with llm finally
    - llm chat with md

- Interface and cli app struct (ll)


# Blockers solved

- string matching fuzzy algo
    - percentage similarity didn't work as the difference could be other than time
    - went with regular expression sorting - pretty good results
    - have to tweek it according to loki api response logs

- so much time
    - used llama.cpp instead of transformers (but limitted fucntionalities like rag)
    - so migrated to ollama that uses llama.cpp behind the scene and makes up chatgpt like api
    - generation speed fixed

- irrelevant outcomes
    - seems like embedding was done wrong like irrelevant chunks
    - fixed by limitting max and min chunk size

- retrieval is little slow
    - change chroma vector db to FAISS (blazing fast)

- retreivel of docs from vector store is done by similarity_search
    - this is good for text based search and faster results but
    - but similarity search isn't much efficient on retrieving logs with natural lang
    - elastic search may do the thing but requires an instance

- need for keyword in the query - related to above blocker
    - turns out to be, using only keyword search
    - have to do sematic search

- vector db created everytime casuing time
    - caching system created
    - created new cache for every new reduce

- context length problem when connect to aws ollama service (unresolved)
    - works well on local server
    - either decrease context length or scale up ollama server (or both)
        - reduce context length and relevancy by decreasing chunk size and increasing k value
        - increase context length using any summary technology or scalling up server resources

# Doing

- Markdown doesn't seem to work, have to check with custom
- The bottlenect slow down seem to happen in retreival part, check that
    - No, it's in creating vector db (solved by caching)
    - and in starting generation (trying to speedup using mutlithreading)

â”‚ The SSH server log shows multiple failed authentication attempts, including those by    â”‚
â”‚ unauthorized or invalid users such as 'cisco', 'admin', and 'matlab'. These incidents   â”‚
â”‚ suggest a potential brute-force attack on your SSH service. It's also noteworthy that   â”‚
â”‚ there are repeated login failures for the root user from different IP addresses         â”‚
â”‚ ('103.99.0.122', '52.80.34.196', and another with a similar pattern). This could        â”‚
â”‚ indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access, especially since the root account has  â”‚
â”‚ significant privileges.                                                                 â”‚

â”‚ Here are some anomalies and potential issues based on these logs:                       â”‚
â”‚                                                                                         â”‚
â”‚  1 Repeated failed login attempts from '103.99.0.122' using various ports which is a    â”‚
â”‚    common sign of an attacker trying different combinations to guess the root password  â”‚
â”‚    or exploit known vulnerabilities (Port scanning).                                    â”‚
â”‚  2 Multiple invalid user attempts ('cisco', 'matlab') and failed authentications for    â”‚
â”‚    unfamiliar users such as 'admin'. This could be either an incorrect configuration    â”‚
â”‚    issue leading to false positives, a misconfigured client attempting access, or it    â”‚
â”‚    may indicate unauthorized attempts by intruders trying different usernames.          â”‚
â”‚  3 Multiple invalid user login attempts from the same IP address ('103.99.0.122') are   â”‚
â”‚    concerning and should be investigated further to ensure system security.             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                         â”‚
â”‚ Actions you can take include:                                                           â”‚
â”‚                                                                                         â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ Enforce strong password policies, ensuring users have complex passwords that cannot  â”‚
â”‚    be easily guessed or brute-forced.                                                   â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ Implement rate limiting on SSH port 22 to prevent automated login attempts and       â”‚
â”‚    potential denial-of-service attacks.                                                 â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ Review your SSH configuration for any misconfigurations leading to false positives   â”‚
â”‚    and ensure users with 'root' privileges have restricted access, ideally through the  â”‚
â”‚    use of key-based authentication instead of passwords.                                â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ Consider using Fail2ban or a similar tool to automatically block IPs that exhibit    â”‚
â”‚    malicious behavior like repeated failed login attempts.                              â”‚
